In this paper, we consider the generalized partial functional linear additive models (GPFLAM) and present the estimation procedure. In GPFLAM, the nonparametric functions are approximated by polynomial splines and the infinite slope function is estimated based on the principal component basis function approximations.

In real data analysis, practitioners frequently come across the case that a discrete response will be related to both a function-valued random variable and a vector-value random variable as the predictor variables. In this paper, we consider the generalized functional partially linear models (GFPLM). The infinite slope function in the GFPLM is estimated by the principal component basis function approximations. Then, we consider the theoretical properties of the estimator obtained by maximizing the quasi likelihood function. The asymptotic normality of the estimator of the finite dimensional parameter and the rate of convergence of the estimator of the infinite dimensional slope function are established, respectively. We investigate the finite sample properties of the estimation procedure via Monte Carlo simulation studies and a real data analysis.</div></p>

In this paper, a new estimation procedure based on composite quantile regression and functional principal component analysis (PCA) method is proposed for the partially functional linear regression models (PFLRMs). The proposed estimation method can simultaneously estimate both the parametric regression coefficients and functional coefficient components without specification of the error distributions. The proposed estimation method is shown to be more efficient empirically for non-normal random error, especially for Cauchy error, and almost as efficient for normal random errors. Furthermore, based on the proposed estimation procedure, we use the penalized composite quantile regression method to study variable selection for parametric part in the PFLRMs. Under certain regularity conditions, consistency, asymptotic normality, and Oracle property of the resulting estimators are derived. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.</div></p>

M-estimation is a widely used technique for robust statistical inference. In this paper, we study model selection and model averaging for M-estimation to simultaneously improve the coverage probability of confidence intervals of the parameters of interest and reduce the impact of heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response. Under general conditions, we develop robust versions of the focused information criterion and a frequentist model average estimator for M-estimation, and we examine their theoretical properties. In addition, we carry out extensive simulation studies as well as two real examples to assess the performance of our new procedure, and find that the proposed method produces satisfactory results.</div></p>

In this article, we develop estimation procedures for partially linear quantile regression models, where some of the responses are censored by another random variable. The nonparametric function is estimated by basis function approximations. The estimation procedure is easy to implement through existing weighted quantile regression, and it requires no specification of the error distributions. We show the large-sample properties of the resulting estimates, the proposed estimator of the regression parameter is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal and the estimator of the functional component achieves the optimal convergence rate of the nonparametric function. The proposed method is studied via simulations and illustrated with the analysis of a primary biliary cirrhosis (BPC) data.</div></p>

In this paper, a class of partially linear additive spatial autoregressive models (PLASARM) is studied. With the nonparametric functions approximated by basis functions, we propose a generalized method of moments estimator for PLASARM. Under mild conditions, we obtain the asymptotic normality for the finite parametric vector and the optimal convergence rate for nonparametric functions. In order to make statistical inference for parametric component, we propose the estimator for asymptotic covariance matrix of the parameter estimator and establish the asymptotic properties for the resulting estimators.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> 
Variable selection has played a fundamental role in regression analysis. Spatial autoregressive model is a useful tool in econometrics and statistics in which context variable selection is necessary but not adequately investigated. In this paper, we consider conducting variable selection in spatial autoregressive models with a diverging number of parameters. Smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty is considered to obtain the estimators. Moreover the dimension of the covariates are allowed to vary with sample size. In order to attenuate the bias caused by endogeneity, instrumental variable is adopted in the estimation procedure. The proposed method can do parametric estimation and variable selection simultaneously. Under mild conditions, we establish the asymptotic and oracle property of the proposed estimators. Finally, the performance of the proposed estimation procedure is examined via Monte Carlo simulation studies and a data set from a Boston housing price is analyzed as an illustrative example.

M-estimation is a widely used technique for robust statistical inference. In this paper, we study robust partially functional linear regression model in which a scale response variable is explained by a function-valued variable and a finite number of real-valued variables. For the estimation of the regression parameters, which include the infinite dimensional function as well as the slope parameters for the real-valued variables, we use polynomial splines to approximate the slop parameter. The estimation procedure is easy to implement, and it is resistant to heavy-tailederrors or outliers in the response. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Finally, we assess the finite sample performance of the proposed method by Monte Carlo simulation studies.

The rate of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators are established under some regularization conditions. With the proper choices of the penalty functions and tuning parameters, it is shown that the proposed procedure can be as efficient as the oracle estimators.

The distorted variables are assumed to be contaminated with a multiplicative factor that is determined by the value of an unknown function of an observable covariate. The authors show that under some appropriate conditions, the SCAD-penalized least squares estimator has the so called “oracle property”. In addition, the authors also suggest a BIC criterion to select the tuning parameter, and show that BIC criterion is able to identify the true model consistently for the covariate adjusted linear regression models. Simulation studies and a real data are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed estimation algorithm.

In this article, we study model selection and model averaging in quantile regression. Under general conditions, we develop a focused information criterion and a frequentist model average estimator for the parameters in quantile regression model, and examine their theoretical properties. The new procedures provide a robust alternative to the least squares method or likelihood method, and a major advantage of the proposed procedures is that when the variance of random error is infinite, the proposed procedure works beautifully while the least squares method breaks down. A simulation study and a real data example are presented to show that the proposed method performs well with a finite sample and is easy to use in practice.

This paper considers the estimation of a semiparametric isotonic regression model when the covariates are measured with additive errors and the response is randomly right censored by a censoring time. The authors show that the proposed estimator of the regression parameter is rootn consistent and asymptotically normal. The authors also show that the isotonic estimator of the functional component, at a fixed point, is cubic root-n consistent and converges in distribution to the slope at zero of the greatest convex minorant of the sum of a two-sided standard Brownian motion and the square of the time parameter. A simulation study is carried out to investigate the performance of the estimators proposed in this article.

In this paper, we propose a variable selection procedure for partially linear varying coefficient model under quantile loss function with adaptive Lasso penalty. The functional coefficients are estimated by B-spline approximations. The proposed procedure simultaneously selects significant variables and estimates unknown parameters. The major advantage of the proposed procedures over the existing ones is easy to implement using existing software, and it requires no specification of the error distributions. Under the regularity conditions, we show that the proposed procedure can be as efficient as the Oracle estimator, and derive the optimal convergence rate of the functional coefficients. A simulation study and a real data application are undertaken to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection procedure.

In this paper, we study M-estimation for the partially linear model under monotonic constraints. We use monotone B-splines to approximate the monotone nonparametric function. We show the large sample properties of the resulting estimators. The proposed estimator of parameter part is root-n consistent, and asymptotically normal and the estimator for the nonparametric component achieves the optimal convergence rate. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the method. The proposed procedure is illustrated by an air pollution study.

This article is concerned with the estimation problem in the semiparametric isotonic regression model when the covariates are measured with additive errors and the response is missing at random. An inverse marginal probability weighted imputation approach is developed to estimate the regression parameters and a least-square approach under monotone constraint is employed to estimate the functional component. We show that the proposed estimator of the regression parameter is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal and the isotonic estimator of the functional component, at a fixed point, is cubic root-n consistent. A simulation study is conducted to examine the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators. A data set is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process---language environment at home---on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</div></p>
